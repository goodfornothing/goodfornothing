	<div class="abstract">
	<p>Good for Nothing is a community of thinkers, do-ers, makers and tinkerers applying their skills 
			and energy to accelerate the work of cause-led innovators and change makers; it's about diverse 
			groups of people collaborating together, working in new, faster, fun and better ways by supporting ideas 
			and people that are leading the way to what a flourishing 21st century society might look like.</p>
	<p>We're trying to solve challenges collaboratively &ndash; on and offline &ndash; through gigs 
			(24 to 48hr think, hack, do creative collaboration events) and here at our web home.There are a number of ways to get involved, but for starters you could get stuck 
			in to a <%= link_to "challenge", challenges_path %> or check out our upcoming gigs and 
			socials on the <%= link_to "calendar", calendar_path %>, we'd love to meet you!</p>

			<h3>Doing,<br /> not talking</h3>
			<p>It's not that hard to talk clever and think big; there's an oversupply of that in our 
			world. Too often big thinking doesn't lead to big doing, yet there are so many problems that need a bit of Do.
			Roll up your sleeves and fail gloriously. 
			Good for Nothing is permission to have a go, get involved, participate and try stuff.</p>

			<h3>Collaborate and experiment</h3>
			<p>These are words we all hear a lot. But true collaboration &ndash; where real diversity and openness is welcomed, where we let go of power and control, where we self-organise and allow ideas and energy to emerge more naturally and where we prototype and develop them rapidly &ndash; is hard to come by. We want more of it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Support the true innovators</h3>
			<p>We give creative energy to the real innovators trying to make positive change happen. 
				Most of the exciting social, environmental and human innovation is happening at the grass-roots. 
				We provide creative support to those pioneers. We think that can help accelerate positive change and impact.</p>

	<h2>Hang on, How do you fund all of this?</h2>
		
	<p>It's a good question, and one we're asked often, so we've written a little guide to <%= link_to "our funding", funding_path %>.</p>
