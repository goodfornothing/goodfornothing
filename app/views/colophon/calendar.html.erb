			<h1>Calendar, the offline bits</h1>
			<p>We love the Interweb, but to solve challenges people also need to get together. Hooking up with likeminded folk at a gig, social, or just for a cuppa and a natter is the Good for Nothing way.</p>
			<p><strong>Gigs</strong> are how GFN started and they continue to be at the heart of what we do; anything from a few hours blast right up to 24-48 hr collaborative experiments. <strong>Socials</strong> are just that, a time to meet up with fellow GFNers, have a natter and be merry.</p>
