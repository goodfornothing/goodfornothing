			<h2>Starting your own chapter</h2>
	
			<div id="chapter_crew">
				<h3>You'll need a crew</h3>
				<p>You'll need a crew, you won't be able to do this on your own. Two or three buddies is perfect. Good for Nothing is about diversity and lots of flavours. 
				<p>Ideally to start you'll have a design and communications flavour, a coding and tech flavour and a strong dose of social innovation &amp; sustainability within your chapter crew. This mix we find can be explosive.</p>
			</div>
	
			<ul id="chapter_flow">
				<li>You'll be Do-ers of some sort, creators, tinkerers</li>
				<li>You'll like ideas</li>
				<li>You'll be well connected in your city</li>
				<li>You'll know how to reach out to different networks</li>
				<li>You'll be ok with 'blagging' stuff &ndash; asking for contributions <br />of space, food, drinks and swag</li>
				<li>You'll like to get things done</li>
				<li>You’ll also like music (we love 4/4 beats ) parties and having a laugh.</li>

			<h3>There are two ways to get started</h3>
			
			<p>Find a pub or cafe, pick a date, invite do-ers and interesting folk from your city. Show and share the Good for Nothing films and how it works. Find out who’s up for it. Form your chapter and go for it.</p>
			
			<p>Big 24 or 48 hour gigs can be ace, but you can sometimes get just as much energy pumping from an evening gig in the pub. If you're up for a full on day or weekender they can take a bit of organising... but they are rollercoaster learning journeys where you meet loads of smart folk and cool things happen to you. </p>
